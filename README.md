# Cosmos [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skidding/cosmos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skidding/cosmos) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/skidding/cosmos/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/skidding/cosmos?branch=master)

A foundation for maintainable web applications.

Cosmos glues [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components together and
creates a uniform relationship between them.

There's no such thing as *controllers* or *pages* in Cosmos, just *components.*
The UI is a tree of components consisting of a root component and its
descendants. Any component can be loaded full-screen as the root element and
a route is just an alias to component _props._

Check out [**Flatris**](http://skidding.github.io/flatris/), a demo app built
with Cosmos.

## Manifesto

_cos·mos<sup>1</sup> `/ˈkäzməs,-ˌmōs,-ˌmäs/` noun — 1. The universe seen as
a well-ordered whole._

- Zero bootstrap
- Can be plugged into any other framework
- Everything is a Component
- Components are oblivious of ancestors
- Any component can be represented by a URI
- The state of the entire UI can be serialized at any given point in time
- Components can implement any data sync mechanism

## Installation

Either install the `cosmos-js` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cosmos-js)
or include the build directly in your project.

```html
<!-- Development build -->
<script src="http://skidding.github.io/cosmos/release/cosmos-0.5.0.js"></script>
<!-- Production build -->
<script src="http://skidding.github.io/cosmos/release/cosmos-0.5.0.min.js"></script>
```

## Specs

In Cosmos, any component in any state can be represented and reproduced by a
persistent JSON. This goes hand in hand with React's declarative nature.

The input data of a component is a JSON object and the role of a component is
to transform its input data into HTML output. Easy to follow and assert
behavior. See [React Component](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html)
for in-depth specs.

### Top-level API

Cosmos can be used as the main router for a web app, but also just for
rendering parts of an existent application.

#### Cosmos.render(props, container, callback)

Mere wrapper for React.render (or React.renderToString, if the `container`
argument is missing), with the extra benefit of the
[componentLookup.](#component-lookup)

#### Cosmos.start(defaultProps, options)

Entry point for a Cosmos Router-powered app. Uses the HTML5 history.pushState
API to cache component snapshots and listen to state changes, rendering
previous components in an instant when going back through history.

The `defaultProps` are extended by the URL query string params. The `options`
are as follows:

- **container** - DOM container to render components in, defaults to
                  `document.body`
- **onChange(props)** - Called whenever the route changes (also initially),
                        receiving the new props every time


Here's how a standard URL for an app powered by the Cosmos Router would look
like:

```
http://mydomain.com/?component=Father&eyes=blue&mood=happy
```

The [URL mixin](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos/wiki/Mixins#url) is used for
routing links using the Cosmos Router.

#### Mixins

See the [Mixins wiki page](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos/wiki/Mixins) for
information on the built-in mixins in Cosmos.

### Core concepts

Reserved props when working with Cosmos: `component`, `componentLookup` and
`state`. The `children` state key is also _magical,_ so it shouldn't be used.

#### Component lookup

In order to make component definitions serializable, Cosmos doesn't work with
classes directly. The `component` prop holds the name of the component, while
the `componentLookup` prop is used for passing a mapping function that returns
corresponding component classes.

Working with the component lookup also results in cleaner component files,
especially when using CommonJS modules with relative paths.

First, we need a component namespace.

```js
var components = {};

// The component classes can be drawn from any global namespace or
// require() mechanism
var componentLookup = function(name) {
  return components[name];
};
```

Then, we attach components to that namespace.

```js
components.Boy = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Cosmos.mixins.ComponentTree],

  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      mood: this.props.initialMood
    };
  },

  render: function() {
    return <span>a {this.state.mood} {this.props.eyes}-eyed boy</span>;
  }
});
```

Once that is in place, we are able to render components without holding
references to their class object.

```js
var props = {
  component: 'Boy',
  componentLookup: componentLookup,
  eyes: 'blue',
  initialMood: 'happy'
};

var boy = Cosmos.render(props, document.body);
```

> "a happy blue-eyed boy"

#### State serialization

The props and state of a component can be joined into a unified snapshot. The
`state` prop holds the state of the component.

```js
// Why do people sleep at night?
boy.setState({mood: 'curious'});

var boySnapshot = boy.serialize();
```

This is what `boySnapshot` will look like:

```js
{
  component: 'Boy',
  componentLookup: [function Function],
  eyes: 'blue',
  initialMood: 'happy',
  state: {
    mood: 'curious'
  }
}
```

Serializing the snapshot is as easy as excluding the `componentLookup` key.

#### State injection

Serializing the state of components is no fun if we can't load it back later.

```js
// The clone will be created in the identical state of the original component
// (with a "curious" mood)
var boyClone = Cosmos.render(boySnapshot);
```

#### Component tree

Cosmos gets interesting when dealing with nested components. The entire state
of a component tree can be serialized recursively, as well as injected top-down
from the root component to the tree leaves.

This is achieved through the `loadChild` API of the `ComponentTree` mixin.

```js
components.Father = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Cosmos.mixins.ComponentTree],

  children: {
    son: function() {
      return {
        component: 'Boy',
        eyes: this.props.eyes,
        initialMood: this.props.mood,
      };
    }
  },

  render: function() {
    return <p>I am the {this.props.mood} father of {this.loadChild('son')}.</p>;
  }
});
```

The parent's props will propagate to its child upon rendering.

```js
var props = {
  component: 'Father',
  componentLookup: componentLookup,
  eyes: 'blue',
  mood: 'happy'
};

var father = Cosmos.render(props, document.body);
```

> "I am the happy father of a happy blue-eyed boy."

However, the child manages its own state from that point on.

```js
var son = father.refs.son;

// We missed the icecream truck :(
son.setState({mood: 'sad'});
```

> "I am the happy father of a sad blue-eyed boy."

We can now generate a recursive snapshot and take a capture of the nested
state.

```js
var familySnapshot = father.serialize(true);
```

This is what the nested snapshot will look like:

```js
{
  component: 'Father',
  componentLookup: [function Function],
  eyes: 'blue',
  mood: 'happy',
  state: {
    children: {
      son: {
        mood: 'sad'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This makes it possible to capture the entire state of an application, persist
it and then reproduce it in a different session.

#### Component Playground

The [Component Playground](components/component-playground.jsx) provides a
minimal frame for loading React components in isolation. It can either render
the component full-screen or with the navigation pane on the side.

It receives a list of fixtures to load, grouped by component name. The fixture
format is identical to a [component snapshot](#state-serialization) in Cosmos.

Working with the Component Playground improves the component design because
it surfaces any implicit dependencies. It also forces us to define sane inputs
for every component, no matter how small, making them more predictable and
easier to debug down the road.

## Development

npm run build-commonjs
```

## Problem

Most web frameworks start out clean and friendly, but at some point after you
go on to build a real-life application on them they stop cooperating and start
turning against you. Finding an honorable route for solving a problem is now a
luxury, workarounds are the norm.

This can happen over and over. Slick at first, unmaintainable in 2 years. But
why is that, why is complexity proportional to the number of features added?

Two reasons:

1. **Interdependence.** Tie a number of units together, rely on one to change
the state of another and you successfully gave birth to
an unpredictable ecosystem
1. **Data obscurity.** Mixing data with logic turns any transparent river of
data into a muddy sewage network and generates a big
pile of opinionated, disposable code.

Avoiding these pitfalls upfront is difficult. They occur only after you've
reached a certain maturity in a program. Easy to notice once the code is no
longer pleasant to work with, but very hard to predict.

Cosmos fights against this uncertainty by surfacing the elements that don't
benefit from a natural tendency to scale.

### Vertical encapsulation

Working with so many entities builds complex relationships. Models,
Controllers, Views, Helpers, etc., they're all connected to each other in
various ways. Your application is the outcome of all sorts of objects with
different roles and behaviors depending on one another.

Scaling you app linearly requires a flat infrastructure. **Responsibilities
should translate into domain logic instead of low-level roles (data
modeling, rendering, etc.)**

Cosmos only has one entity: The Component. They are autonomous, have end-to-end
capabilities and each can function as a complete application by itself,
excluding interdependence from the start. Because they can describe their
output without relying on any external logic, components are declarative and
predictable.

Isolating the source of a bug now has O(1) complexity.

### Transparent data structures

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers
> worry about data structures and their relationships.

Cosmos is partly inspired by a Linus Torvalds
[comment](http://lwn.net/Articles/193245/) about **designing your code
around your data and not the other way around.**

But Cosmos does not impose any specific data structures, it simply makes them
surface and hard to miss. All component logic wraps around a single JSON
object, which starts as the component input and updates along with state
changes. That object will always be a visible, persistent data structure.

## Contributing

Cosmos has been built alongside a bigger UI project for over six months, but
is still is the process of being defined. A few things from the current roadmap:

- ~~Remove DataFetch mixin from project~~ [#100](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos/pull/100)
- ~~Remove jQuery dependency (only DataFetch mixin uses it for XHR calls)~~ [#100](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos/pull/100)
- ~~Migrate tests from jsdom to either PhantomJS or plain Node~~ [#101](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos/pull/101)
- Add props editor to ComponentPlayground
- Enhance Router with customizable routes
